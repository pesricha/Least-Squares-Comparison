\begin{question} {Problem 3 \\
Given the matrix:
\[
A = \begin{pmatrix}
0.70000 & 0.70711 \\
0.70001 & 0.70711
\end{pmatrix}
\]
(a) Consider a computer which rounds all computed results to five digits of relative accuracy. Using either Classical Gram-Schmidt (CGS) or Modified Gram-Schmidt (MGS), compute the matrix $Q$ associated with the QR decomposition of $A$ assuming you are working on such a computer.

(b) Apply Householderâ€™s method to compute the QR factorization of $A$ using the same 5-digit arithmetic. Compare the matrices $Q_1$ obtained in (a) and (b), and comment on the orthogonality of the $Q$ matrix.}

\end{question}

\begin{question}{Problem 5 \\
In this problem, you will test different algorithms for the least squares problem to approximate the function \( f(t) = \sin(10t) \) for \( t \in [0,1] \) using a polynomial fit. To this end, first generate \( m = 100 \) data points using the above function, which forms your given data, i.e., \( (t_i, f(t_i)) \) for \( i = 1, \dots, m \). Using this data, we would like to construct a 14th-degree least squares polynomial fit to \( f(t) \). Determine its least squares fit using the following methods:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item[(a)] Use QR Factorization with your implementation of Modified Gram-Schmidt. You should write your own back-substitution code for solving the resulting triangular system.
    
    \item[(b)] Using QR Factorization with your implementation of Householder factorization.
    
    \item[(c)] Using SVD (Computed with any inbuilt libraries in MATLAB/Python/Octave).
    
    \item[(d)] Using normal equations, you can use the backslash command in MATLAB to solve this system.
\end{enumerate}

Accept the MATLAB/Octave/Python least squares solution (given by "backslash" \( \backslash \) in MATLAB) as the truth. Display and plot the approximation given by this "true" solution and compare it with \( f(t) \). Compare with the solutions given by the 4 methods described above. Explain the results.
